<HTML><BODY>In 1881, the Indian pandit (scholar) Sarat Chandra Das traveled to what was at that time an almost hermetically closed country, which the British were looking at with an eager eye. As an Indian speaking the language (he also produced a grammar and large dictionary of Tibetan), he would have had less trouble entering the country than Europeans, who were distrusted (probably justified, given their behaviour in India and China). Unfortunately, Das also worked as a spy for the British in Tibet, and thus betrayed the trust of many Tibetans he befriended.

<p>Unlike the Tibetan grammar I've recently unleashed in the rounds, this work does not include exotic scripts, and is thus offered as an alternative for those interested in Tibet, but unable to help with the grammar (and later the dictionary). The text does include a large number of footnotes, in which the British editor sometimes belittles the author.

</p><p>The illustrations are very nice, especially the coloured sketch-maps of temples and palaces.

</p><p>Have fun!
